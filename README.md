# Social Network API

This application utilizes Node.js to implement a collection of APIs, catering to the functionalities of a social network web application. Users can engage in activities such as sharing thoughts, reacting to friends' thoughts, and managing a friend list. The APIs offer comprehensive CRUD operations, enabling the addition, retrieval, update, and deletion of users, friends, thoughts, and reactions through Express routes. Given the social nature of the platform, MongoDB is employed for data modeling, and the Mongoose package is utilized for seamless data modeling and manipulation.
